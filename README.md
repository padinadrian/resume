# Adrian Padin's Resume
My resume, updated periodically. Latest version is [AdrianPadinResume.pdf](AdrianPadinResume.pdf)

## Building with LaTeX
You can generate the PDF yourself from the TeX files.

On Windows you will need to download and install a LaTeX compiler. I recommend MiKTeX: https://miktex.org/download

On Ubuntu/Debian Linux and Mac you should already have a TeX compiler installed.

Then open your respective terminal and type in the following command:

```
pdflatex AdrianPadinResume.tex
```

This will generate a file named `AdrianPadinResume.pdf`
